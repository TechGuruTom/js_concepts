# Anonymous Function or Self Involked Function


An anonymous function is a function that does not have a name. In JavaScript, functions can be defined in two ways: named functions and anonymous functions.

Named Function:

```javascript
function addNumbers(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

Anonymous Function:

```javascript
const addNumbers = function(a, b) {
  return a + b;
};
```

In the example above, `addNumbers` is a named function, and it has a name `addNumbers`. On the other hand, the second function is an anonymous function because it does not have a name after the `function` keyword. Instead, it is assigned to a variable (`addNumbers`) as a function expression.

Anonymous functions are useful when you need to create functions on the fly or pass functions as arguments to other functions (higher-order functions). They are commonly used in scenarios like event handlers, callbacks, and immediately-invoked function expressions (IIFE).

Example of using an anonymous function as an event handler:

```html
<button id="myButton">Click me</button>
```

```javascript
const button = document.getElementById('myButton');

button.addEventListener('click', function() {
  console.log('Button clicked!');
});
```

In this example, we attach an anonymous function as an event handler for the `click` event of the `myButton` element. When the button is clicked, the anonymous function is executed, and it logs "Button clicked!" to the console.

Anonymous functions are quite versatile, and they can be defined and used in various ways to suit different programming needs. However, one limitation of anonymous functions is that they cannot be called recursively since they don't have a name to refer to themselves. In such cases, named functions or function declarations are required.
